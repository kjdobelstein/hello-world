# hello-world
My first repository created under instructions found in the GitHub Hello World tutorial
I'm a strategically minded dude that likes creating technology and loves working with people. I primarily develop hardware for a small avionics company. I also have experience as a Scrum Master, Product Owner, project manager, and technology professional mentor.
